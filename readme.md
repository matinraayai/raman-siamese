A recreation of the paper 
[Dynamic Spectrum Matching with 
One-shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09981) 
in pytorch with a wide range of Raman spectra datasets available;
Including:
- [RRUFF Raman spectra 
dataset](https://rruff.info/zipped_data_files/raman/).
- Modified Version of 
[DeepCID](https://github.com/XiaqiongFan/DeepCID) Simulated Dataset
with all the component labels extracted using their previously 
trained models.
